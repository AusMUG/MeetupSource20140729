========================
Using this for AusMug project team members perusal and acclimation to our github projects!


MeetupSource20140729
====================

This is the basic, "Hello, MEAN!", source code that we wrote/discussed during our AusMUG meetup on 7/29/2014.

The following two files are specific to sublime text 2 editor that I use.  
You can disregard if you something else like webstorm or text mate.

1) hellomean.sublime-project
2) hellomean.sublime-workspace

Note:
Remember to have at least the nodejs and expressjs installed.  I'll try to put instructions
for this in here as soon as I can, or at least a pointer to a good intro to.  Or we can just 
google it.  Anyone feel like adding to this note?  Please do so! :-) 

Note: 
Remember to have mongodb server running with the respective db and collection we worked 
on that night.  I'll try to get more specific instructions in here.  Anyone want to contribute
to this note?  Please do so.  

That's all for now!  I'm excited to hear about anyone that ran this successfully or ran their 
own version of a "Helo, MEAN!" app!  Please let us know!

Talk to you all soon!
